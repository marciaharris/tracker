# The name of the project is Your Friendly Task
This is a task tracker that allows users to record their tasks with motivational quotes and cute pictures of cats to keep the user in good spirits. Unique features include a *card component* generated for each task for easy seperation. This is a solo project that showcases my React skills and my ability to solve problems using logic in my src-components folder. I am proud of my API integration and the CSS styling I employed. 

**In order to set up this project you need to run npm install**.
Afterwards run npm run dev and follow the instructions to open the localhost link.


# The technologies I am using include React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Other technologies are SWR and axios
Axios is being used to fetch the data from the API and SWR is being used to save that data to a cache and renders it for optimized load time.
